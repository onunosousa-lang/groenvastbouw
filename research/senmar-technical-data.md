## Energy Performance Data

### Passive House Standards (Passivhaus)
- **Heating demand:** Maximum 15 kWh/m²/year
- **Total primary energy:** Maximum 60 kWh/m²/year (heating, hot water, electricity)
- **Peak heating load:** Maximum 10 W/m²

### Traditional House vs Passive House Comparison
**Energy Consumption:**
- **Traditional house:** 169.85 kWh/m²/year (measured data)
- **Passive house:** 64.11 kWh/m²/year (measured data)
- **Savings:** ~62% reduction in energy consumption

**Alternative data:**
- **Traditional house:** ~100-150 kWh/m²/year (typical Dutch home)
- **Passive house:** 12-15 kWh/m²/year (heating only)
- **Savings:** Up to 90% less energy for heating and cooling

### EPC Labels Netherlands
- **EPC (Energy Performance Coefficient):** Standard Dutch energy label
- **Passive House:** Typically achieves EPC label A++ or A+++ (highest ratings)
- **Traditional house:** Usually EPC label C, D, or E
- **Mandatory:** EPC required when selling or renting property

## Dutch Tax Benefits & Subsidies (2024-2025)

### ISDE (Investeringssubsidie Duurzame Energie en Energiebesparing)
**Budget:** €550 million available in 2025, runs until 2030

**For Homeowners:**
- Insulation measures
- Heat pumps
- Solar boilers
- District heating connection
- Electric cooking facilities

**For Business Users:**
